# BestFriend
A flexible Brainfuck interpreter written in C. Very much in progress so far.

## Objectives
* Support as many environments as possible (8-bit, 32-bit, wrapping, non-wrapping, etc.
* Be fast - optimize repeated processes such as arithmetic and moving pointers.

## Building
On Linux systems, just `git clone` this repository, then `make` in its root directory. Your binary will be in `bin/a.out`.
